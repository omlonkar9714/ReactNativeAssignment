a. Bottom Navigation menu with 2 option (Home, messages) and on selection the menu items will change color to indicate which one is selected)

1. You can use this API for displaying images in carousel

2. Display 5 images in Carousel and at least 20 in grid (use count parameter in the API request to get desired no. of images). You can hit API twice ,once for carousel and once for grid
3. Create a github repo and make it public. Make sure only the required things are on git and try to create PRs for small small tasks like project setup and then setting up navigation etc.

I faced github multiple account issue in my sourcetree due to which i had to push the code in one go after solving the issue, other than that every requirement has been fullfilled.
Thank you. It was a exciting assignment for me.
